Expense Tracking Application

The expense tracking application was developed using the Java programming language, the Spring Boot framework, and MariaDB as the database. For the graphical user interface, Java Swing was employed to ensure simplicity and ease of use.

The application, in its current state, is functional and allows for easy user registration on a personal computer, entry of transactions, and their display within a table. Additionally, it supports the generation of PDF reports on the recorded transactions.

The primary goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding and proficiency with the Spring Boot framework. The application will continue to be developed and enhanced in the future.
